This extension provides an alternative to the ever growing complexity
of ES module build systems like webpack. The fundamental complexity of
build systems is often not needed when building low cost frontend applications
with TYPO3. The importmap generator for TYPO3 aims to reduce complexity
and make it easy to precisely import ES modules without the need of a build system.
This is possible with the easy to use importmap generator which is configured
with the site settings.yaml file.
